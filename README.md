# 🚦 AI-Powered Traffic Management System

This is a full-stack, real-time traffic control system built using computer vision, Flask, YOLOv8, SQLite, and a live admin dashboard. Designed to optimize traffic signal behavior, prioritize emergency vehicles, detect red-light violations, and assist traffic administrators with real-time control and oversight.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project simulates an intelligent traffic intersection control system using Raspberry Pi (for deployment), Python, and a browser-based dashboard. It includes:

- Real-time vehicle detection using YOLOv8
- Smart traffic signal selection based on congestion
- Emergency vehicle override with delay buffer
- Red-light violation detection and evidence capture
- Full administrative dashboard with live analytics
- System audit logs for traceability
- Simulated intersection view and demo tools

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Backend | Flask (Python) |
| AI/Detection | YOLOv8 via Ultralytics |
| Database | SQLite |
| Dashboard | HTML + CSS + JS (Vanilla) |
| Visualization | Leaflet.js, Animated HTML UI |
| Video Capture | OpenCV |
| Runtime | Raspberry Pi (target), Windows/Linux (dev) |

---

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 📷 Input
- One or more video feeds (e.g., USB cam, IP cam)
- YOLOv8 detects vehicles per frame

### 🧮 Processing
- `VehicleProcessor` assigns vehicle detections to lanes
- `TrafficLightController` dynamically selects the active green lane
- Emergency detection temporarily overrides normal flow
- Red-light violators are captured and logged with screenshots

### 🖥️ Output
- Flask API updates shared `state`
- Live dashboard fetches API data every 5s
- Admin can override signals or simulate conditions
- Logs and violations are stored and exported

## 🧪 Key Features

### 🧠 AI-Powered Vehicle Detection
- YOLOv8 runs on every frame
- Vehicle bounding boxes classified into directions (north, south, etc.)

### 🚦 Smart Signal Control
- Lanes with the highest car count are prioritized
- A failsafe kicks in if no dominant lane exists
- Manual override via dashboard

### 🚨 Emergency Vehicle Priority
- Detected via input trigger or simulation
- Overrides current cycle with a delay buffer
- Deactivates automatically when vehicle exits frame

### 🚫 Red Light Violation Detection
- Triggers when car crosses stop line on red
- Screenshot evidence captured
- Incident logged to database
- Can be simulated via admin panel

### 📤 CSV Report Export
- Incidents exportable via dashboard
- Preformatted with ID, timestamp, lane, folder, etc.

### 🧾 System Audit Logs
- Every event is tracked:
  - Override toggles
  - Violation triggers
  - Export actions
  - Emergency activations
- Logs viewable in dashboard

### 🌍 Real-Time Intersection View
- Leaflet.js map of Gemmayzeh intersection
- Directional camera markers
- Simulated lane activation with animated lights

## 💻 Demo Tools

Use these from the dashboard to simulate events:

| Tool | Action |
|------|--------|
| ✅ Simulate Violation | Fakes a red-light run |
| ✅ Force Override | Picks a green lane manually |
| ✅ Export CSV | Downloads report for all active incidents |

---

## 🧱 Simulated Intersection View

A lightweight animated panel is embedded in the dashboard that:

- Mimics a 4-way intersection
- Lights update in real-time based on system state
- Provides a visual alternative to Unity or SUMO

## ⚙️ Setup & Run

1. Install requirements:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run YOLO on live camera:
   ```
   python multi_cam_run.py
